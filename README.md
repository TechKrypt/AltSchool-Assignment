# AltSchool HTML and CSS Project

## Overview

This is my first project for AltSchool, where we were tasked to demonstrate our expertise in HTML and CSS. In this project, I created four files:

1. *index.html*
2. *form.html*
3. *media.html*
4. *table.html*

## Files and Descriptions

### form.html
The task for form.html was to replicate exactly the AltSchool registration portal. The form is designed to look and function just like the actual registration page, with proper input fields, labels, and a submit button.

### index.html
The index.html file is a different task altogether, focusing on creating a unique and visually appealing homepage using HTML and CSS. This page serves as the main entry point to the project.

### media.html
In media.html, the challenge was to utilize the entire range of media elements in HTML. This includes images, videos, audio, and any other media types that HTML supports, showcasing the ability to integrate media into web pages effectively.

### table.html
The table.html file contains a simple table that lists all the courses and schools offered by AltSchool. This task was designed to test the ability to structure and present data in a clean, organized table format.

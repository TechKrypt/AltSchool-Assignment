# AltSchool HTML and CSS Assignment

## Overview

This project is an assignment where I was tested on various concepts of HTML and CSS. The project consists of four files: signup.html, profile.html, media.html, and table.html. These files have been uploaded to GitHub and are hosted on Netlify. You can view the live site at [Godzilla.netlify.app](https://Godzilla.netlify.app).

## Files and Descriptions

### profile.html
The profile.html file serves as the home page of the website. It includes information about my AltSchool ID, a brief biography, reasons for joining old school, and my goals.

### signup.html
The signup.html file is designed to replicate the AltSchool signup form. The goal was to create a form that closely resembles the original signup interface of AltSchool, utilizing proper input fields and labels.

### media.html
In the media.html file, the task was to use all the HTML media elements to create a visually engaging page. This includes embedding images, videos, and audio elements.

### table.html
The table.html file contains a table listing all the schools, and courses offered by old school. The table is designed to be simple yet functional, allowing for easy reference of the information.
